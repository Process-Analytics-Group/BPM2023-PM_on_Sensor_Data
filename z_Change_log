2021-03-16
DJ: Moved limit_data_input method from a_EventCaseCorrelation to method that reads in csv, so input is pruned
    before any code is executed

2021-03-11
DJ: Moved load_raw_data from a_EventCaseCorrelation to utils folder.
    No need to load the raw file every iteration.
DJ: Only keep motion sensors (data_frame[data_frame['SensorID'].str.startswith('M')].index) in u_utils
DJ: Added choose_event_case_correlation_method to be able to choose between the old raw data to
    traces method and the new one implemented by Master Project
